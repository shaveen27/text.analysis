\title{SVM Classification Accuracy Measures}
\usage{
svm_classification(
  data,
  kernel = "radial",
  gamma = 1/ncol(data$train),
  cost = 1,
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{list of length 2 from \link[text.analysis]{partition}}

\item{kernel}{the kernel used in training and predicting. You might consider
changing some of the following parameters, depending on the kernel type.}

\item{gamma}{parameter needed for all kernels except linear
(default: 1/(data dimension))}

\item{cost}{cost of constraints violation (default: 1)â€”it is the
'C'- constant of the regularization term in the Lagrange formulation.}

\item{...}{futher parameters from \link[e1071]{svm} function}
}
\value{
\link[base]{list} with length 3
}
\description{
This function is designed to compute accuracy measures for email data set
using Support Vector Machine classification model. This function return the
model, confusion matrix and accuracy measures.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# input data list "df"
df <- list(
  type = c("ham", "spam", "ham", "ham", "spam"),
  message = c(
    "hey there how is your day going",
    "you have won a free vacation click here to claim your prize",
    "reminder meeting today do not forget",
    "just wanted to say hi and see how you are doing",
    "your account has been compromised click here to update your password"
  )
)

# create train and test data using partition function
model_df <- final_model_df(df, 2)
train_test_ls <- partition(model_df, 0.6)

# run SVM with RBF Kernel
svm_classification(train_test_ls)
